    Question #1

    Would you be more likely to implement the following as a composition or an aggregation?
    a) A ball that has a color = com
    b) An employer that is employing multiple people = agg
    c) The departments in a university = com
    d) Your age = com
    e) A bag of marbles = agg
    */

    /*
    Question #2

    Update the Department/Teacher example so the Department can handle multiple Teachers. The following code should execute:

    #include <iostream>

    // ...

    int main()
    {
    // Create a teacher outside the scope of the Department
    Teacher t1{ "Bob" };
    Teacher t2{ "Frank" };
    Teacher t3{ "Beth" };

    {
        // Create a department and add some Teachers to it
        Department department{}; // create an empty Department

        department.add(t1);
        department.add(t2);
        department.add(t3);

        std::cout << department;

    } // department goes out of scope here and is destroyed

    std::cout << t1.getName() << " still exists!\n";
    std::cout << t2.getName() << " still exists!\n";
    std::cout << t3.getName() << " still exists!\n";

    return 0;
    }

    This should print:

    Department: Bob Frank Beth
    Bob still exists!
    Frank still exists!
    Beth still exists!

    */

    // Create a teacher outside the scope of the Department
 
    Teacher t1{ "Bob" };
    Teacher t2{ "Frank" };
    Teacher t3{ "Beth" };

    {
        // Create a department and add some Teachers to it
        //Department department_Quiz{};// create an empty Department

        //department_Quiz.add(t1);
        //department_Quiz.add(t2);
        //department_Quiz.add(t3);
